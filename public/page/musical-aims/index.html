<p>Music is an emotionally-charged medium. It has the power to elicit strong emotional reactions from the listener through various musical techniques and patterns. As listeners, our reactions to different musical sounds are a product of the musical culture with which we are familiar. For example, in the Western Classical tradition, <strong>major</strong> tonalities are associated with happiness, positivity, and optimism, whereas <strong>minor</strong> tonalities are associated with sadness, negativity, and pessimism. Similarly, consonance is associated with beauty, levity, and relief, whereas dissonance is associated with conflict, anger, and tension.</p>

<p>My aim in the sonification of these data sets was to allow the data to speak for itself, instead of prescribing emotional reactions to the data based on compositional techniques and musical patterns. Thus, all examples presented on this website are completely algorithmically generated. In doing this, I allowed the data to be the focal point, and the music simply a vehicle to convey the changes in the data. Any association or reaction from the listener are thus a product of changes in the data, and not a learned response to the music. This also allows listeners with different musical backgrounds and from varied musical cultures to start on equal footing - musical modes and patterns specific to certain regions and cultures have been avoided, and what remains is a direct representation of data, perceptualized musically.</p>

<h2 id="sonification-examples-presented-on-this-site">Sonification Examples Presented on this Site</h2>

<p>This site offers three different approaches to sonification techniques. The first uses a whole tone scale to perceptualize the data using dynamics, pitch variations, and tonal ambiguity. The second uses a single chord to represent the data with dynamic and to use the perception of a chord as a whole to illustrate the idea of all of the clinical parameters changing within one patient. The third sonification technique uses chord alternation to perceptualize the data using changes in dynamics, pitch class, texture, and tonal ambiguity. In each sonification example, the user will hear a pulsing beat - this helps to represent markers and the passage of time in a way that is much more difficult to convey than if using long, sustained, legato sounds.</p>

<h3 id="whole-tone-scale">Whole Tone Scale</h3>

<p>A whole tone scale is a hexatonic (six-note) scale that spans an octave in which each note is separated from both its preceding and subsequent notes by an interval of a whole tone. This differs from the diatonic (heptatonic - seven-note) scales, such as the major (Ionian) and minor (Aeolian) scales that are familiar to listeners of the Western Classical musical tradition, which feature seven notes (five whole steps and two half steps) that span the octave.</p>

<p>I chose a whole tone scale to represent the data because it offered a chance to use pitch to mirror the rising and falling of levels while avoiding the emotional associations that a listener may have to certain musical modes (such as major and minor) and because a whole tone scale has no sense of a tonal center. In a whole tone scale, all notes are the same distance apart, which makes the scale completely symmetrical. This means that no note is more important than another. A whole tone scale has no leading tone (the pitch that resolves, or leads to, the tonal center of a key, which results in listener associations of resolution, completeness, calm, and finality).</p>

<p>In the whole tone sonification examples presented here, I represented the changes in data through the manipulation of dynamic and pitch. As the average levels of the clinical parameters rise and fall in increments of 10%, so do the pitches in the scale. Higher pitches represent higher levels, and lower pitches represent lower levels. Within the changes of pitches, the dynamics (volume) of the pitches are changing at a much more granular level. The volume of a certain note is a direct representation of the average level of the clinical variable at that time - for example, an average of 1 would be represented by the note playing at 100% volume, an average of 0.4258 would be represented by a note playing at 42.58% volume, and an average of 0 would be completely silent. Thus, the crescendi (increases in volume) and decrescendi (decreases in volume) directly mirror the increases and decreases in the levels of the clinical parameters in the weeks leading to death.</p>

<h3 id="single-chord">Single Chord</h3>

<p>A chord is a harmonic set of pitches (usually three or more notes) played at the same time. The chord used in these sonification examples is a minor/minor 7th chord with D as the root (D♮ - F♮ - A♮ - C♮). A minor/minor 7th chord is a chord that contains intervals of a minor 3rd above the root, a perfect 5th above the root, and a minor 7th above the root - its name is derived from the intervals of the pitches above the root of the chord. This is a diatonic chord, meaning that there is no chromatic alteration, and it is not heard as overtly consonant or dissonant. Additionally, it is not immediately identified as major or minor as a major/minor triad would be because of the addition of the minor 7th above the root of the chord. The chord is also a non-dominant chord. In a key, the dominant is the second most important note in the key. The dominant (specifically a dominant 7th chord) always leads back to tonic and is the basis for most cadences in Western tonal music. Since a minor/minor 7th chord is non-dominant and also has no leading tone, the listener is not anticipating a resolution to the tonic. Thus, the use of a repeated minor/minor 7th chord avoids the idea of a tonal center, as well as consonance vs dissonance and the immediate association of major and minor.</p>

<p>In this sonification example, I manipulate the dynamics in the same way described above, with the rise and fall of the dynamics directly mirroring the rising and falling of the average levels of the clinical parameters. Additionally, I wanted to use the idea of a chord as a whole to give the sense that the four variables being examined combine to create one whole; one chord can represent one person, and each note in that chord represents the various levels changing within that patient&rsquo;s body in the weeks leading to death. The notes being played simultaneously gives the sense of one whole with different moving parts, which I felt could be a poetic illustration of what the data is representing.</p>

<h3 id="chord-alternation">Chord Alternation</h3>

<p>Harmonic progression is a series of chords played in succession and is the basis of harmony. Certain chord progressions also have strong associations with suspense and relief. For example, in the Western Classical tradition, when a musical piece begins, it starts in a certain tonality. As the piece continues, the composer goes through different chord progressions which lead through different tonal areas, building suspense as the listener finds themselves further from the tonality in which the piece began. Eventually, the composer returns to the initial tonality (known as tonic), bringing relief to the listener. If you have ever noticed that a song seems to be nearing its end or have realized that a song is over as soon as you have heard the last note, the reason that you know is because a familiar harmonic progression (known as a cadence) has brought you back to the original tonality of the piece, providing relief.</p>

<p>For the chord alternation in the sonification example, I chose two chords whose alternation would not hint at any familiar harmonic progressions that would provide suspense and/or relief to the listener. To perceptualize the data musically, I employed dynamics in the same manner described above, as well as pitch class and texture. Pitch class is a set of notes that are all the same note but played in different octaves. For example, all eight &ldquo;C&rdquo;s that are on a piano belong to the same pitch class. In this musical example, the alternating chords are made up of notes from several pitch classes - the higher pitch classes are played when the levels are higher, and the lower pitch classes are played when the levels are lower.</p>

<p>Additionally, I played with texture to further represent the data. A thicker musical texture, illustrated by more notes being played and an emphasis on the off-beats, occurs when the levels of the clinical parameters are higher, and a thinner musical texture (represented by less notes being played and the emphasis on the on-beat only) occurs when the levels of the clinical parameters are lower.  Due to the thicker texture of this sonification example I changed the instrumentation slightly, using the drum as the percussion instrument, instead of the guitar, as used in the previous examples, because I found that it worked best to cut through the thicker texture of the piece.</p>
