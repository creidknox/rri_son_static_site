Music is an emotionally-charged medium. It has the power to elicit strong emotions from the listener through various musical techniques and patterns. As listeners, our reactions to different musical sounds are learned by the musical culture with which we are familiar. For example, in the Western Classical tradition, **major** tonalities are associated with happiness, positivity, and optimism, whereas **minor** tonalities are associated with sadness, negativety, and pessamism. Similarly, consonance is associated with beauty, levity, and relief, whereas dissonance is associated with conflict, anger, and tension.

My aim in the sonification of these data sets was to allow the data to speak for itself, instead of perscribing emotional reactions to the data based on compositional techniques and musical patterns. Thus, all examples presented on this website are completely algorithmically generated. In doing this, I allowed the data to be the focal point, and the music simply a vehicle to convey the changes in the data. Any association or reaction from the listener are thus a product of changes in the data, and not a learned response to the music. This also allows listeners with different musical backgrounds and from varied musical cultures to start on equal footing - musical modes and patterns specific to certain regions and cultures have been avoided, and what remains is a direct representation of data, perceptualized musically.

## Musical Techniques/Patterns to Avoid
- Major/minor
- Consonance/dissonance
- Familiar harmonic progressions
- Tonality/tonal center

## Musical Techniques/Patterns to Employ
- Pitch
- Pitch Class (Octaves)
- Dynamic (Volume)
- Texture
- Tonal ambiguity
